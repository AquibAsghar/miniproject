		<h2>Education & Employment</h2>
		<p>I went to Montgomery Primary School and then Hodgehill Secondary School.

		In year 9 I was the only student in the year to achieve a level 8 in Maths in my SATs (I didn't even know a level 8 grade even existed lol)

		Got my GCSEs in Mathematics, English Lit & Lang, Science, Double Science and acheieved 4 Dinstincion* in ICT.

		I then went on to study A level Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, ICT at Sutton Colfield College (thought i was going to become a doctor lol). 

		After college I went to the University of Birmingham and studied Chemistry. I am a very curious person and enjoying learning and understanding the whys and hows to how everythings works/exists. I enjoy learning about science and technology in particular. I graduated with a 2.2 in 2015.

		In March 2016 I began working for Extra Energy an independent power supply; I was primarily responsible for managing business and residential accounts and occasionally dealing with customer complaints. As I did particularly well during training, I was placed on the SME team. By using the in-house systems and national databases, I had to find the root cause of the problem and resolve the issue all whilst meeting my call handling targets. In addition to this, as I exceeded expectations at my role, I was been given additional responsibilities. One of many included a senior advisor role which allows me to train and coach certain individuals to reach their targets and achieve their goals.

		My technical skills had also been noticed by the management team and my peers. I was placed on a development plan for a real time analyst role as a progression opportunity and have recently learnt SQL and VBA. I have used my knowledge of Excel and VBA scripting to streamline business processes and I have worked on Excel projects for management. I am also regularly approached by my colleagues and assist them with any technical challenges they may face.
