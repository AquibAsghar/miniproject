		<h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
		<p>Many would describe myself as having a very curious mind, I enjoy learning and understanding why and how everything around me works. I am extremely passionate about the rapidly progressing technology industry and the resulting impact it has on our day to day lives. I enjoy keeping up to date with the latest trends and innovations in hardware and software. One of my hobbies is to build computers, I have built several computers for family, friends and for myself. I enjoy tweaking and optimising my computer to ensure I get the best performance possible. As a result, I aspire to work in and further my knowledge of the IT industry.</p>

		<p>A big passion of mine is body building. I enjoy learning about the science and nutrition behind body building and all of the beneficial effects working out has on your physical and mental health.</p>

		<p>Another passion, or rather addiction of mine is gaming.

		My first game console was a Playstation 1 and the very first game that I played was Spyro the Dragon. A few other games I also had were Crash Bandicoot 3, Street Fighter, Rayman!, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Heart of Darkness.

		Rayman and Heart of Darkness are 2 of the most difficult games I've played. I enjoyed the challenge and skill required and the satisfaction of completing difficult missions/levels/games etc</p>

		<p>I then got a playstation 2 and my first 3 games were Ratchet and Clank, Jack and Daxter and Eyetoy! I loved action/adventure games and I thought the Eyetoy was fantastic. I eventually purchased Kingdom Hearts which went on to be my favourite gaming franchise. I loved mix of disney, final fantasy and the action/rpg combat style. I had many games on PS2. I even had a chipped PS2 from Pakistan that could play ripped games lol

		I remember when Kingdom Hearts 2 came out, I was so hyped and eager to play it, I could NOT wait for my dad to take me to the game store on the weekend. I ended up riding my bike for about an hour to the Fort Shopping Centre and bought my from the Game Store there. I loved Kingdom Hearts 2, it was fantastic and I can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 3.</p>

		<p>Soon after I got hooked to Runescape, i spent way too many hours on that game grinding away to make money and level up my character. My first account was Killah_aquib lmao. I then went on to make dragonite_x and dragonzite_x (legit names i know lmao). It was my first MMORPG and one that I will never forget. I made lots of friends on that game and enjoyed the open world and being able to train and learn different skills and different combat styles. I loved the huge PK trips and different clans/rivalries. 

		At one point I reached the maximum cash stack of 2.147billion. This is because the largest integer value Java 32 bit can store is 2,147,483,647. My brother still plays and sells the money to chinese gold farmers for real money</p>

		<p>I then bought a playstation 3 the day it came out. The first game I bought was Resistance: Fall of Man. This was my first ever fps shooting game and my first online game where you compete against other players (not including Runescape). I got hooked, the competitive aspect of playing against real human opponents and being more skilled and beating the enemy team was an amazing feeling. It fueled my competitve drive through the roof. Ever since then I have been playing FPSes such as Call of Duty. I reached the point where stomping public players wasn't satisfying enough. I started playing competitively on gamebattles and one of my highlights is this clip of me 1v4ing the best team on the European Ladder RoughNeX (RNX).</p>

		<p>Eventually I built a gaming pc using my University grant money lol. I got into League of Legends and was addicted to that. It was my first MOBA game and I enjoyed the learning curve and ability to outsmart and outplay your opponent. I managed to climb to Diamond 3 which is high elo and my favourite champion was yasuo.

		I still play League of Legends pretty regularly and even got into Overwatch which is one of my first FPS games on PC. I managed to get diamond elo on that too in one season.

		I even made a Yasuo montage on League of Legends which has over 20,000 views.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, as I have been gaming on PC for the past few years, I have become garbage with a controller on console. But I enjoy gaming on PC much more. Thats the end of my auto biography on my gaming addiction, I didnt even get to cover everything lol.</p>
